# Lemonade is an Android-focused 3DS Emulator ___fork___

***We plan to add new features and enhancements on top of the ___base___ emulator***

## PC Builds?

For now we have no plans to make a PC version of Lemonade for 2 reasons 

- There are other forks focusing on PC development 
- We lack the knowledge to actually improve the PC version of this emulator 

However if you want to help with making a PC version of this emulator you can contact us on discord and we may reverse this decision

## HOW TO BUILD THE APK?

**Dependencies (Windows)**
- Android Studio
- NDK and CMake
- Git
