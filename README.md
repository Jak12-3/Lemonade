# Lemonade is an Android-focused 3DS Emulator ___fork___

***We plan to add new features and enhancements on top of the ___base___ emulator***

# Notice ⚠️

**THE LEMONADE APK WILL BE PUBLISHED ONCE WE FEEL THE PROJECT HAS ENOUGH CHANGES MADE TO IT FROM THE BASE. WE DONT WANT TO RELEASE A RESKINNED APK WITH NO CHANGES**

You can track the progress we have made below

## What's new so far 

- Added a option to adjust touch controls opacity 
- A few hacks ported from Citra MMJ
- (WIP) Redesigned In-game properties menu 

### PC Builds?

For now we have no plans to make a PC version of Lemonade for 2 reasons 

- There are other forks focusing on PC development 
- We lack the knowledge to actually improve the PC version of this emulator 

However if you want to help with making a PC version of this emulator you can contact us on discord and we may reverse this decision

## HOW TO BUILD THE APK?

Even though we haven't officially released the APK you may still want to test it out so here's how to build from source 

**Dependencies (Windows)**
- Android Studio
- NDK and CMake
- Git

If you get the error ```invalid linker name in argument '-fuse-ld=gold'``` when starting compiling (A rebbot is needed after installing these)
- Visual Stidio Build Tools (C++ Tools)
- [MinGW-W64](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries)

###  Compiling
- Start Android Studio, on the startup dialog select Open
- Navigate to the citra/src/android directory and click on OK
